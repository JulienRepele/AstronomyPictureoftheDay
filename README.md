## Astronomy Picture of the Day
An app that simply displays the photos served by the [*Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) microservice*](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api#docs-)

Currently testing Hilt, material3, Jetpack Compose and Paging for Compose.

Tested on a Pixel 4a with Android 12.

This is just a pet project to try new things.
You can expect breaking changes, unused code and various code smells.
**Use it at your own risk!**
